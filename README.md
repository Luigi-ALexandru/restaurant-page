# restaurant-page

In this project, I'm utilizing Webpack for the first time. As a result, I've chosen to employ SCSS and leverage Webpack's capability to convert it into plain CSS that browsers can understand.

Additionally, I intend to create separate JavaScript files for each page on the website to enhance loading times.

Consequently, Webpack will serve a dual purpose in this project: translating code for browser compatibility and optimizing loading times for improved performance!
